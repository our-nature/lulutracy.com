Born in Malaysia, my mom's garden was my playground. Moments among the plants while she worked cultivated a comforting familiarity with nature that encouraged deeper appreciation, and later nostalgia. Now based in New York, I find home in the similarities I see in nature. Over the past eight years, I channeled that inspiration by studying and pursuing a career in graphic design but later reconnected to art through painting.

In my paintings, I strive to capture the essence of the natural world in a way that is both evocative and unpretentious. I work with watercolors and acrylics, I explore organic forms with deep, vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes that reflect the flowing association of my memories of and emotions towards nature.

My work is deeply inspired by the interconnectedness and impermanence of memory, nature, and imagination. I can revisit experiences and emotions I felt as a child by spending time with and appreciating nature and observing natural processes unfold. This practice reveals the delicate balance of nature, where each element works in harmony with the others. My paintings show how nature intersects with my memories and imagination.

I am, and we as humans are part of nature. By uncovering how nature describes the human condition, I hope my art can remind people of the fragility of the world we live in, and it's inherent beauty.
